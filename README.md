# TLE-ME-Thesis-Project
This research project creates an algorithm of downloading TLEs, propagating the satellites and filtering out their intended positions, changes to a satellite’s orbit over time could be plotted and observed, which is the goal of this project.  The idea is to create an algorithm that would flag potential unmodeled changes of satellites’ orbits..
